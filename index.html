                <p>I enrolled in University Of Adelaide coding bootcamp, not to change career or get a job, but to learn web full stack development as part of a skill required by my startup company to 
                design and develop an IoT tracking product for a particular market segment. I could employ a developer but, since the coding bootcamp is a fast-track 26-week course, I decided to learn 
                the skill myself. I have always been keenly interested in web design including full stack web development and the new technologies that go with it. Upon completion, I will probably do some freelance work as I 
                and have six paying clients already waiting! Also, I have a good graphic designer, who can create visual impact and visual flow, to partner with.<br>My professional background is engineering (biomedical and rehabilitation) 
                with graduate business studies (Innovation and Entrepreneurship). The business studies taught me that, to be successful in business, it is essential to learn marketing to understand human behavior and how to persuade! 
                And isn't social media (digital marketing) a great medium for persuasion!<br> In recent years, I have diversified into establishing and managing (with my wife) a successful business of local manufacture and supplier
                 of corporate uniform to a national airline! The business currently has no website landing page... but it will soon once I have learned how to design one!!<p>
